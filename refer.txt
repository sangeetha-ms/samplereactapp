Virtual DOM Vs Real DOM

- Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house which is Real DOM.

In summary, hereâ€™s what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.


A ReactElement is a light, stateless, immutable, virtual representation of a DOM Element.
ReactComponents are stateful. -  whenever the state changes, the component is rerendered:

function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(
    element,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
